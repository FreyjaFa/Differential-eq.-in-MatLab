# Differential Equations in MATLAB

Welcome to the **Differential Equations in MATLAB** repository! This repository contains the MATLAB code used in my YouTube lecture series on solving differential equations. These codes demonstrate key concepts, numerical methods, and practical examples, helping students and enthusiasts grasp the applications of MATLAB in solving differential equations.

## Contents
This repository includes:

- **Example Scripts**: Step-by-step MATLAB implementations of methods such as:
  - Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
  - Numerical solvers (e.g., `ode45`, `ode23`, etc.)
  - Boundary Value Problems (BVPs)
  - Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
- **Annotated Code**: Clear comments and explanations accompanying the code.
- **Supporting Materials**: Auxiliary files to aid in understanding and experimenting with the lectures.
